# TikTok Content Classification

## Description:
TikTok is a platform that inspires creativity and brings joy. However, if used incorrectly, it may spread misinformation and create clashes in society or other damages. To maintain the integrity of the platform, it is crucial to classify videos according to standard guidelines.

TikTok users can submit reports identifying videos and comments containing user claims, which require review by moderators. The volume of reports is challenging to manage promptly. TikTok is developing a predictive model to identify if a video contains a claim or an opinion. This model aims to reduce report backlogs and prioritize efficiently.


## Project Goals:
- Develop a predictive model to classify videos based on content.
- Reduce backlog of reports by prioritizing them efficiently.
- Maintain the integrity and safety of the TikTok platform.


## Tasks:
- Build a predictive model for video classification.
- Implement algorithms to prioritize reports for moderation.
- Monitor and optimize model performance for accuracy and efficiency.
